# Logtree

Inspired by avanier, this project include several mini apps inside such as tracker [time, link, and activity], url shortner, and file storage and many more.

# Time tracker

Like any other time tracker app, this include the duration of the activity that you track, there is nothing special.

# Issue tracking 
- Don't let other user crud other user records like timers, solution ? check if the user owned that property or where condition in prisma?
- change tid into timerId @timer.jsx and api/timer/index


# UI Brainstorming
- Instead of drop down, how about select on a listed label and highlight it?

# Framework
Built with Nextjs + NextAuth + PlanetScale + Prisma + TailwindCSS

# Huggingface
This is just some bonus for fun.
